    <h2>Rewards</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="#mayor">Mayor's Reward</a>: <Mayor /> promises 20,000 gold pieces on completion of
      the contract. However, if this is paid out, it will be paid in golden lions, the local
      Cormyrean currency. Due to fluctuations in local markets, and pressures upon the local
      magistrates, golden lions are worth approximately 1/2 of gold currency used elsewhere in
      Faer√ªn. The total payout can be converted to 10,000 gold pieces total, for the party.

      CHEF'S REWARD: 2,000 golden lions + CHEF's SECRET COOKBOOK, which gives +5 to all cooking
